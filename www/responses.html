      <h2>Intercooler Requests &amp; Responses</h2>

      <p>Intercooler makes AJAX requests to various paths when certain events occur (e.g. A button with a
      <code>ic-post-to</code> attribute is clicked, or a polling interval occurs.) and expects a response
        of a certain format (typically an HTML fragment).  Below we describe both the request and response formats.</p>

      <h3>Intercooler Requests</h3>

      <p>
        Intercooler requests can come take four different forms:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>GET</code> - Typically created due to a refresh of an <code>ic-src</code> attribute.</li>
        <li><code>POST</code> - Created by an element with a <code>ic-post-to</code> attribute.</li>
        <li><code>PUT</code> - Created by an element with a <code>ic-put-to</code> attribute.</li>
        <li><code>DELETE</code> - Created by an element with a <code>ic-delete-from</code> attribute.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Because not all browsers support <code>PUT</code> and <code>DELETE</code> requests in AJAX, Intercooler
        uses the Rails convention and adds a <code>_method</code> parameter to the request.
      </p>

      <h4>Standard Parameters</h4>

      <p>
        Intercooler requests include a few standard parameters:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>ic-request</code> - This will always be <code>true</code> for Intercooler-based requests.</li>
        <li><code>ic-last-refresh</code> - This is a timestamp of the last time the target element was refreshed.
          This can be used to calculate time-sensitive UI updates (e.g. appending to a list of messages.)</li>
        <li><code>ic-fingerprint</code> - The SHA256 fingerprint of the current content.  This can be used to avoid
        sending down unnecessary updates, caching, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Additional Parameters</h4>

      <p>
        Also included in the request is the form value of the element that is initiating the request.  So, if
        the element is an input, it will include its name/value in the request.  If it is a form, it will include
        the names/values of all inputs within the form.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also include other parameters using the <a href="/attributes/ic-include.html"><code>ic-include</code></a> attribute.
      </p>

      <h3>Intercooler Responses</h3>

      <p>Intercooler responses are typically HTML fragments.  In the typical case, a fragment of HTML will be returned.
        Here is a simple example of a response body:</p>

      <pre>

  &lt;div>Here Is Some Content!&lt;div>
      </pre>

      <p>This would be swapped in as the body of the element that initiated the request.</p>

      <p>The returned content can contain Intercooler attributes itself, which will be all wired up.</p>

      <p>You can control the exact style of the swap using the
        <a href="/attributes/ic-transition.html"><code>ic-transition</code></a> attribute, and you can
      control the element that will be swapped out via the request by using the
        <a href="/attributes/ic-target.html"><code>ic-target</code></a> attribute.</p>

      <h4>Empty Bodies</h4>

      <p>Intercooler interprets an empty body in a request as a No-Op, and will do nothing in response.</p>

      <h3>Intercooler HTTP Response Headers</h3>

      <p>Sadly, not all UI patterns can be elegantly captured via straight element swapping. Occasionally
        you need to invoke a bit more client side javascript, let other elements know to refresh themselves,
        redirect the user entirely, etc.</p>

      <p>To handle these situations, Intercooler responses have at their disposal some custom HTTP headers.  These
        headers can be used to instruct intercooler to perform additional work :
      </p>

      <p>The following Intercooler response headers are available:</p>

      <table class="table table-striped table-hover">
        <thead>
