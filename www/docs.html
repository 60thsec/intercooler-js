      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>IntercoolerJS is a <strong>very early and rough</strong> idea.  It is half-thought out and one-tenth implemented
      at this point, but it points towards a simpler, more incremental way of introducing AJAX and dynamic behavior into
      web applications.</p>

      <p>The core ideas in IntercoolerJS are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>HTML Elements are declaratively bound to HTTP endpoints via standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.)</li>
        <li>Dependencies between elements are encoded in URL paths</li>
        <li>It is a scaleable library, and you can use it for as much or as little of your UI as you'd like</li>
        <li>It is a pluggable library, allowing you to override many behaviors, but it provides good defaults for
        things like transitions so, if you aren't interested, you won't need to change anything to have an
        attractive, usable app.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>IntercoolerJS is a javascript library that lets you introduce dynamic behavior to your web applications without
      adding any javascript.  It accomplishes this by allowing you to bind various elements (and attributes) to HTTP
      end points using custom HTML attributes.  You don't need to write a line of javascript, although you certainly can if
      you'd like.</p>

      <p>As a motivating example, consider this div:</p>
      <div class="row">
        <pre class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

    &lt;div ic-src="/visitors/count_div" ic-poll="2s">You have had 42 visitors today&lt;/div>
        </pre>
      </div>

      <p>This div will poll the given URL, <code>/visitors/count_div/</code> by issuing an AJAX <code>GET</code>
        every two seconds.  If the response HTML is different, it will swap in the new elements in place
        of the existing element.</p>

      <h3>Inspiration</h3>

      <p>IntercoolerJS was inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/rails/turbolinks/">Turbolinks</a> project,
        <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">DHH's</a> various posts
        regarding using incremental DOM updates in Basecamp.</p>

      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>Intercooler is just another javascript library.  It depends on JQuery being installed.</p>
      <p>Here is an example installation:</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      <pre>
  &lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js">&lt;/script>
  &lt;script src="/js/intercooler-0.0.1-alpha1.min.js">&lt;/script>
      </pre>
    </div>

      <h2>IntercoolerJS Attributes</h2>
      <p>The core of IntercoolerJS is a set of attributes that enable dynamic behavior on HTML elemetns.  Below is a table
        of each attribute, and a summary of what it does.</p>
      <table class="table table-striped table-hover">
        <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style="width:120px">Attribute</th>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Documentation</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>ic-src</td>
            <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Source</td>
            <td>This attribute allows you to bind an element to a given URL.  Once it is bound, when a change occurs that
            IntercoolerJS recognizes as affecting the URL (or given an event such as a poll), IntercoolerJS will issue
            a <code>GET</code> to the URL and replace the element with the new content, if it is different.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>ic-dest</td>
            <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Destination</td>
            <td>This attribute allows you to bind the "action" of an element to a given URL.  Once it is bound, when an
              "action" occurs (e.g. clicking a button) IntercoolerJS will issue
            a <code>POST</code> to the URL and replace the element with the new content, if it is different.  Intercooler
            will detect any other elements that the <code>POST</code> effects and automatically refresh them.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>ic-poll</td>
            <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Poll</td>
            <td>This attribute allows you to instruct an element to poll its source for changes at a given interval.  Valid
            values are, for example, "500ms" or "2s"</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>ic-style-src</td>
            <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Style&nbsp;Source</td>
            <td>Like <code>ic-src</code>, this attribute allows you bind to a URL.  However, this attribute binds a
            <strong>style</strong> attribute to a URL.  The syntax is "<em>style-attribute</em>:<em>url</em>".  For example,
            to bind the color of an element to "/color/random", you would say <code>ic-style-src="color:/color/random"</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>ic-attr-src</td>
            <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Attribute&nbsp;Source</td>
            <td>Like <code>ic-style-src</code>, this attribute allows you bind to a URL.  However, this attribute binds an
            <strong>attribute value</strong> to a URL.  The syntax is "<em>attribute</em>:<em>url</em>".  For example,
            to bind the style of an element to "/style/random", you would say <code>ic-attr-src="style:/style/random"</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>ic-deps</td>
            <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Dependencies</td>
            <td>This attribute allows you to specify additional dependencies of a element in the form of paths that
            should cause the element to refresh.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>ic-include</td>
            <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Include</td>
            <td>This attribute allows you to include additional parameters in all Intercooler-generated requests.  The
            attribute values can either be of the form '$(<em>jQuerySelector</em>)', in which case the selected element
            will be serialized and included, or of the form '<em>name:expr</em>' where the name of the paramter will be
            <code>name</code>, and the value will be the evaluated value of <em>expr</em>.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>

      <h2>IntercoolerJS Dependencies</h2>
      <p>IntercoolerJS manages dependencies by using the path of the URLs in the various <code>src</code>, <code>deps</code>
        and <code>dest</code> attributes.</p>

      <p>If a POST is made to <code>/foo/bar/baz/</code> then anything depending on <code>/foo</code>, <code>/foo/bar</code>,
       <code>/foo/bar/baz</code> or <code>/foo/bar/baz/*</code> will be refreshed.  However, something depending on
        <code>/foo/bar/qux</code> will <strong>not</strong> be refreshed.
      </p>

      <p>This allows you to express your UI element dependencies in a natural, hierarchical manner that fits well with
      many application patterns.</p>
