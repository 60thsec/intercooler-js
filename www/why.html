      <h2>Why Use Intercooler?</h2>

      <p>The primary advantage of Intercooler is <strong><em>simplicity</em></strong>.</p>

      <p>Using <strong>simple, declarative attributes</strong> you can build <strong>rich, interactive user
      interfaces</strong> in your application while avoiding the overhead (and sometimes, <em>overkill</em>) of
        MVC frameworks.</p>

       <p>With intercooler.js, you don't need client-side models, routing, validation, rendering, factories,
         dependency injection, etc, eliminating a major source of complexity, inconsistency and
         security problems in your application.</p>

      <h2>How Does Intercooler Work?</h2>

      <p>Intercooler is a <em>Partial View Controller</em> framework: it communicates with the
        server via AJAX, but rather than using JSON responses, it uses fragments of HTML (i.e. <em>Partial Views</em>),
        which are then loaded into the DOM directly.</p>

      <p>This is in contrast with older, more traditional MVC frameworks such as
        <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> or <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a>, which use
        JSON and client-side rendering.</p>

      <p>Here is a diagram showing a PVC request:</p>

      <p class="text-center">
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="images/pvc_request.svg"/>
      </p>

      <p>The AJAX response content is a <strong>partial</strong> bit of HTML, and it is swapped into the DOM directly.</p>

      <p>Examples of some PVC frameworks are <a href="https://github.com/rails/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax">pjax</a>.</p>

      <p>Intercooler formalizes this pattern using simple, declarative attributes, making PVC-style programing
        easy, flexible and fun.</p>
