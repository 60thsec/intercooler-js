    <h1><i class="fa fa-asterisk red"></i> Intercooler.JS</h1>

    <p>Intercooler allows you add AJAX to your web-application with as little (or as much) javascript as you would like.
      Bindings and dependencies are managed via REST-ful URLs using HTML5 declarations.</p>

      <h2>Scaleable</h2>

      <p>You can use Intercooler.JS for as much or as little of your application as you like. It mixes in cleanly with
        either traditional web-app methodology or fancy-pants single-page-app libraries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Declarative</h2>

      <p>Keeping the simple stuff simple, you can use easy to understand REST-ful urls to specify a server-side UI model
        for your HTML elements. Of course, Intercooler is pluggable, so you can drop into javascript whenever you'd
        like.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Automatic Dependency Detection</h2>

      <p>Intercooler uses pattern matching in your REST-ful URLs to detect and refresh dependencies between independent
        elements. Typically it will do the right thing without any additional work on your part. Of course, if you need
        to add or ignore dependencies, Intercooler allows you to do that as well.</p>
