    <h1><i class="fa fa-asterisk red"></i> Intercooler.JS</h1>

    <p>Intercooler allows you add AJAX to your web-application with as little (or as much) javascript as you would like.
      Bindings and dependencies are managed via REST-ful URLs using HTML5 declarations.</p>

  <script>
    var clicks = 0;
    Intercooler.setRemote({
      get: function (url, callback) {
        if (url == "/btn/1/clicks") {
          console.log('here');
          callback('<span ic-src="/btn/1/clicks">You have clicked the button ' + clicks + ' times...</span>');
        }
      },
      post : function(url, data, callback) {
        if (url == "/btn/1/clicks") {
          clicks++;
          callback("");
        }
      }
    });

      <h2>Scaleable</h2>

      <p>You can use Intercooler.JS for as much or as little of your application as you like. It mixes in cleanly with
        either traditional web-app methodology or fancy-pants single-page-app libraries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Declarative</h2>

      <p>Keeping the simple stuff simple, you can use easy to understand REST-ful urls to specify a server-side UI model
        for your HTML elements. Of course, Intercooler is pluggable, so you can drop into javascript whenever you'd
        like.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Automatic Dependency Detection</h2>

      <p>Intercooler uses pattern matching in your REST-ful URLs to detect and refresh dependencies between independent
        elements. Typically it will do the right thing without any additional work on your part. Of course, if you need
        to add or ignore dependencies, Intercooler allows you to do that as well.</p>

      <h2>Framework Agnostic</h2>

      <p>Although it was inspired by <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-partials">Partials</a>
        in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, IntercoolerJS can work equally well with any back end platform.  Additionally, it is designed to play
      well with other Javascript frameworks, so you can use <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> or
        <a href="http://emberjs.com/">EmberJS</a> in places your UI call for it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Bootstrap Friendly</h2>

      <p>IntercoolerJS works fine with any HTML/CSS framework, but it was designed with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
      in mind, making it easy to create dynamic UIs using standard, simple Bootstrap techniques.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Pluggable</h2>

      <p>IntercoolerJS was designed from the ground up to be pluggable so, when push comes to shove, you can customise
      pretty much any part of the it you need to.  On the other hand, Intercooler provides sensible, attractive defaults
      so you won't need to do much if you don't want to.</p>
