      <h2>Declarative</h2>

      <p>With Intercooler you can use easy to understand, declarative attributes to bind your HTML elements to
        AJAX end points.</p>

      <p>Intercooler is a pragmatic library, however, so you can drop into javascript when it's necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Incremental</h2>

      <p>You can use Intercooler for as much or as little of your application as you like.</p>

      <p>No need to wholesale adopt a new framework to start adding AJAX functionality to your application!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Plays Well With Others</h2>

      <p>Intercooler is a little library built to play well with other web technologies, like AngularJS, EmberJS and Turbolinks.</p>

      <p>Use the right tool for the particular job: Intercooler won't get in the way.</p>

      <h2>Dependency Detection</h2>

      <p>Intercooler uses pattern matching in your URLs to detect and refresh dependencies between HTML
        elements. Typically it will do the right thing without much work on your part. And, if you need
        to add or ignore dependencies, Intercooler allows you to do that as well.</p>

      <h2>Framework Agnostic</h2>

      <p>Although it was inspired by <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-partials">Partials</a>
        in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, IntercoolerJS works equally well with any back end platform.</p>

      <p>IntercoolerJS works great with any HTML/CSS framework, but was designed with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
      in mind, making it easy to create dynamic UIs using the standard, simple Bootstrap techniques.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Open</h2>

      <p>IntercoolerJS was designed to be open and extensible so, when push comes to shove, you can customise
      pretty much any part of the it you need to.</p>
