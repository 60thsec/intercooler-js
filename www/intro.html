      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Intercooler is a javascript library that lets you introduce dynamic behavior to your web applications without
        adding much javascript. It accomplishes this by allowing you to bind various elements (and attributes) to HTTP
        end points using custom HTML attributes.</p>

      <p>The core ideas in Intercooler are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>HTML Elements are declaratively bound to HTTP endpoints via standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.)</li>
        <li>Dependencies between elements are encoded in URL paths</li>
        <li>The API is scaleable, and you can use it for as much or as little of your UI as you'd like</li>
        <li>The API is pluggable, allowing you to override many behaviors, <em>however</em> it provides
          good defaults for things like transitions so, if you aren't interested, you won't need to
          change anything to have an attractive, usable app.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Intercooler was inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/rails/turbolinks/">Turbolinks</a> project,
        <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">DHH's</a> various posts
        regarding using incremental DOM updates in Basecamp.</p>

      <h2>Installation</h2>

      <p>Intercooler is just another javascript library. It depends on JQuery being installed.</p>

      <p>Here is an example installation:</p>

      <pre>
  &lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js">&lt;/script>
  &lt;script src="/js/intercooler-0.0.1-alpha1.min.js">&lt;/script>
      </pre>

      <p>You can grab the latest code from the <a href="download.html">Downloads</a> page.</p>

      <h2>A Motivating Example</h2>

      <p>A good example is usually the best way to introduce something, so let's take a look at
        a simple div that has an Intercooler binding:</p>

      <div class="row">
        <pre class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

    &lt;div ic-src="/visitors/count_div" ic-poll="2s">You have had 42 visitors today&lt;/div>
        </pre>
      </div>

      <p>This div will poll the given URL, <code>/visitors/count_div/</code> by issuing an AJAX <code>GET</code>
        every two seconds. If (and only if) the response is different, it will swap in the html in place of the existing
        div.</p>

      <p>Here is the div in action:</p>

      <div class="live-demo">
        <script>
          (function () {
            var count = 42;
            Intercooler.pushRemoteHandler({
              'url': '/visitors/count_div',
              'get': function () {
                if(Math.random() > .5) {
                  count += Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
                }
                return '<div ic-src="/visitors/count_div" ic-poll="2s">You have had ' + count + ' visitors today</div>'
              }
            });
          })();
        </script>
        <div ic-src="/visitors/count_div" ic-poll="2s">You have had 42 visitors today</div>
      </div>

      <h3>Handling Events</h3>

      <p>The example above is passive, it sits in the background polling the URL without any user input.  Let's remove
      that and, instead, make it respond to a button click:</p>

      <div class="row">
        <pre class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

    &lt;div ic-src="/example/click">You have not yet clicked the button&lt;/div>
    &lt;button ic-dest="/example/click">Click Me!&lt;/button>
        </pre>
      </div>

      <p>Here we've removed the <code>ic-poll</code> attribute and introduced a button with a new attribute,
        <code>ic-dest</code>.  This tells Intercooler to post to <code>/example/click</code> when the button
      is clicked.</p>

      <p><em>And then some magic happens...</em></p>

      <p>Intercooler detects that the div <em>depends</em> on the URL that the button posted to, and so it does a
      refresh on that element.  This is how Intercooler encodes UI dependencies: it uses URLs to determine what elements
      on the current page need refreshing based on events and actions.</p>

      <div class="live-demo">
        <script>
          (function () {
            var clicks = 0;
            Intercooler.pushRemoteHandler({
              'url': '/example/click',
              'get': function () {
                return '<div ic-src="/example/click">You have clicked the button ' + clicks + ' times</div>'
              },
              'post': function(){
                clicks++;
              }
            });
          })();
        </script>
        <div ic-src="/example/click">You have not yet clicked the button</div>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" ic-dest="/example/click">Click Me!</button>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

      <h2>Intercooler Attributes</h2>

      <p>The core of Intercooler is a set of attributes that enable dynamic behavior on HTML elemetns. Below is a
        table
        of each attribute, and a summary of what it does.</p>
      <table class="table table-striped table-hover">
        <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style="width:120px">Attribute</th>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Documentation</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>ic-src</td>
          <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Source</td>
          <td>This attribute allows you to bind an element to a given URL. Once it is bound, when a change occurs that
            Intercooler recognizes as affecting the URL (or given an event such as a poll), Intercooler will issue
            a <code>GET</code> to the URL and replace the element with the new content, if it is different.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ic-dest</td>
          <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Destination</td>
          <td>This attribute allows you to bind the "action" of an element to a given URL. Once it is bound, when an
            "action" occurs (e.g. clicking a button) Intercooler will issue
            a <code>POST</code> to the URL and replace the element with the new content, if it is different.
            Intercooler
            will detect any other elements that the <code>POST</code> effects and automatically refresh them.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ic-poll</td>
          <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Poll</td>
          <td>This attribute allows you to instruct an element to poll its source for changes at a given interval.
            Valid
            values are, for example, "500ms" or "2s"
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ic-style-src</td>
          <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Style&nbsp;Source</td>
          <td>Like <code>ic-src</code>, this attribute allows you bind to a URL. However, this attribute binds a
            <strong>style</strong> attribute to a URL. The syntax is "<em>style-attribute</em>:<em>url</em>". For
            example,
            to bind the color of an element to "/color/random", you would say
            <code>ic-style-src="color:/color/random"</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ic-attr-src</td>
          <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Attribute&nbsp;Source</td>
          <td>Like <code>ic-style-src</code>, this attribute allows you bind to a URL. However, this attribute binds
            an
            <strong>attribute value</strong> to a URL. The syntax is "<em>attribute</em>:<em>url</em>". For example,
            to bind the style of an element to "/style/random", you would say
            <code>ic-attr-src="style:/style/random"</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ic-deps</td>
          <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Dependencies</td>
          <td>This attribute allows you to specify additional dependencies of a element in the form of paths that
            should cause the element to refresh.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ic-include</td>
          <td>Intercooler&nbsp;Include</td>
          <td>This attribute allows you to include additional parameters in all Intercooler-generated requests. The
            attribute values can either be of the form '$(<em>jQuerySelector</em>)', in which case the selected
            element
            will be serialized and included, or of the form '<em>name:expr</em>' where the name of the paramter will
            be
            <code>name</code>, and the value will be the evaluated value of <em>expr</em>.
          </td>

      <h2>Intercooler Dependencies</h2>

      <p>Intercooler manages dependencies by using the path of the URLs in the various <code>src</code>,
        <code>deps</code>
        and <code>dest</code> attributes.</p>

      <p>If a POST is made to <code>/foo/bar/baz/</code> then anything depending on <code>/foo</code>,
        <code>/foo/bar</code>,
        <code>/foo/bar/baz</code> or <code>/foo/bar/baz/*</code> will be refreshed. However, something depending on
        <code>/foo/bar/qux</code> will <strong>not</strong> be refreshed.
      </p>

      <p>This allows you to express your UI element dependencies in a natural, hierarchical manner that fits well with
        many application patterns.</p>
