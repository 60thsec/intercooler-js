  <h4>Comments</h4>

  <p>
    The big enhancement in this release (small code change, but <strong>big</strong> functionality boost!) is the <code>X-IC-Trigger</code>
    response header, which finally solves a tricky problem I've been wrestling with: How do you communicate server side state
    changes that have client-side UI ramifications that fall outside the usual Intercooler request-and-replace
    partial view flow?
  </p>

  <p>This new mechanism allows you to cleanly separate your server side and client-side logic even in cases where the
    simple content-swapping approach isn't enough.</p>

  <p>A great example is if you want to hide a modal if and only if a form in the modal submits valid data to the
    server.  You can now easily fire an <code>server.accountCreated</code> event from the server side and respond
  to that on the client side by hiding the modal.</p>

  <p>You can download the latest <code>intercooler.js</code> from <a href="/download.html">the Downloads page</a>.</p>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>
