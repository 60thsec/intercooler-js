    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <p>
    The big change (small code change, but <strong>big</strong> conceptual change!) is the <code>X-IC-Trigger</code>
    header, which finally solves a tricky problem I've been wrestling with: How do you communicate server side state
    changes that have client-side UI ramifications that are outside the usual Intercooler request-and-replace
    flow?
  </p>

  <p>This new mechanism allows you to cleanly separate your server side logic and your client-side logic even in
  cases where the normal flow isn't enough.</p>

  <p>A great example is if you want to hide a modal if and only if a form
    in the modal saved properly via an intercooler request.</p>
